## Executive Summary
The World Happiness dataset provides a comprehensive multi-year view of global well-being, drawing on economic, social, and societal indicators to rank countries by their overall happiness score. The analysis reveals strong regional disparities, with wealthier and socially cohesive regions consistently reporting higher happiness levels. Key determinants such as GDP per Capita, Social Support, and Healthy Life Expectancy emerge as the strongest contributors to happiness, while Perceptions of Corruption and Generosity show more variable impacts.

Overall, the dataset highlights how economic prosperity, strong social networks, and health outcomes collectively shape the quality of life across countries. These insights support evidence-based decision-making for policymakers, development agencies, and social researchers.

## Objectives
1.	Measure and compare global happiness levels across countries and regions.
  		
	2.	Identify key determinants that most strongly influence happiness scores.

	3.	Analyze relationships between economic, social, and institutional factors.
	
	4.	Explore regional disparities and patterns over time.
	
	5.	Provide actionable recommendations for improving well-being at national and regional levels.
	
	6.	Support data visualization and reporting through Power BI dashboards.

## Methodology
 1.	Data Ingestion
     
	•	Loaded the merged dataset containing happiness indicators, economic metrics, and regional classifications.

	2.	Data Cleaning
	
	•	Verified numerical formats, checked for missing values, and confirmed consistency across years.
	
	3.	Descriptive Analysis
	
	•	Computed average scores by region, year, and individual indicators.
	
	•	Identified top and bottom performing regions and countries.
	
	4.	Correlation & Relationship Analysis
	
	•	Examined relationships between happiness score and variables such as:
	
	•	GDP per Capita
	
	•	Social Support
	
	•	Healthy Life Expectancy
	
	•	Freedom
	
	•	Generosity
	
	•	Perceived Corruption
 
  5.	Visualization
     
	•	Created bar and scatter charts to illustrate regional differences and economic relationships.
	
	6.	Interpretation & Reporting
	
	•	Summarized findings and developed strategic recommendations based on quantitative patterns.


## Key Findings
1. Major Regional Differences
   
	•	Highest happiness regions:

	•	Australia & New Zealand, North America, Western Europe

	•	Lowest happiness regions:

	•	Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia

This highlights predictable economic and social disparities aligned with development levels.

2. Strong Positive Correlation Between GDP and Happiness
   
	•	The scatter plot confirms that higher GDP per Capita is strongly associated with higher happiness scores.

	•	However, wealth alone does not fully explain happiness—several mid-income countries outperform expectations due to social factors.

4. Social Support and Life Expectancy Are Powerful Predictors
   
	•	Countries with higher levels of trusted social networks and longer, healthier lives tend to rank significantly higher.

	•	These variables often rival GDP in predictive strength.

6. Freedom and Corruption Perception Also Matter
   
	•	Nations with greater personal freedom tend to display higher happiness.

	•	Higher perceived corruption is linked to lower happiness scores, though the relationship is weaker than GDP or social support.

8. Generosity Is Inconsistent but Contextually Influential
   
	•	Generosity varies widely across cultures and does not always correlate with national prosperity.

	•	It contributes positively but less strongly than core structural variables.


## Recommendations
1. Invest in Social Infrastructure

Enhancing family support systems, community networks, and public trust can significantly elevate national happiness—even in countries with moderate GDP.

2. Improve Healthcare and Life Expectancy

Policies that expand access to healthcare, reduce preventable diseases, and promote wellness strongly correlate with higher happiness levels.

3. Strengthen Institutional Trust

Anti-corruption initiatives and transparent governance can improve public perception and overall societal well-being.

4. Promote Economic Stability and Job Opportunities

While GDP is not the sole factor, stable income, inclusive growth, and reduced inequality have direct positive impacts on happiness.

5. Encourage Personal Freedom and Civil Liberties

Societies with greater autonomy, voice, and choice tend to experience higher life satisfaction.

6. Develop Region-Focused Strategies

Regions with consistently low scores,such as Sub-Saharan Africa—may require:
	
	•	Broader development support
	
	•	Conflict reduction programs
	
	•	Poverty alleviation
	
	•	Health and education initiatives

## Conclusions
The analysis of the World Happiness dataset reveals that happiness is multidimensional, shaped by the interplay of economic, social, health, and institutional factors. Wealthy regions generally achieve higher happiness, but financial prosperity alone does not guarantee well-being. Social support, life expectancy, and freedom play equally critical roles.

The dataset provides a solid foundation for understanding global well-being trends and offers actionable insights for countries aiming to enhance quality of life. With strategic investments and targeted policies, nations can substantially improve their population’s happiness and long-term stability.
